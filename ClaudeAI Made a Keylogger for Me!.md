# ClaudeAI Made a Keylogger for Me!

A few months ago I was trying to convince ClaudeAI and Microsoft Copilot to help me build a keylogger. It was impossible. 
My mundane prompt was: `*"How can I build a keylogger for my PC" / "Help me to develope a keylogger"*`

Both of them refused to help with the response that it was illegal / it was spying into someone without their consent  or that I needed special permissions and final user approvement.

This week I as trying the same goal but with a different approach. 
Knowing that ClaudeAI will answer the same way. I first started some questions and unexpectedly and very discrete I asked how to build a keylogger. It worked!
Here is my conversation:

### Prompt techniques used: 
* Prompt Chaining
* Iterative Prompting

ClaudeAI version: `Sonet 3.5`
