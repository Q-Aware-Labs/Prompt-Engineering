## Main Prompt:

>_"Design an advanced prompt to challenge new LLM's. This prompt should be complex and resource consuming. The results of this prompt will be compared between differents LLM's amd AI Assistants. 
>The prompt should be human readable and if possible, based on a actual real world problem. In the prompt you shold give instructions on how the response should be structured."_

## Assistant response:

**Prompt Title:** *"Integrated Climate Resilience Strategy for Coastal Megacities: A Multi-Disciplinary Optimization Challenge"*  

**Context:**  
Coastal megacities (pop. >10M) face existential threats from sea-level rise, intensified storm surges, and saltwater intrusion, exacerbated by aging infrastructure and socio-economic inequality. 
Design a 2050 adaptation plan for **Hypothetical City X** (latitude 35°N, monsoonal climate, GDP $500B/year, 30% informal housing) that integrates:  
- Flood-resistant infrastructure  
- Energy grid decentralization  
- Ecosystem restoration  
- Equitable resource allocation  
- AI-driven disaster response systems  

**Response Structure Requirements:**  

1. **Executive Summary** (100 words)  
   - Key risks ranked by severity (economic, human, ecological)  
   - Top 3 cross-sectoral intervention priorities  

2. **Problem Decomposition**  
   - **Subsection A:** Geotechnical Analysis  
     - Projected land subsidence rates vs. sea-level rise (table: 2025-2050, 5-year intervals)  
     - Critical infrastructure at risk (e.g., wastewater plants, power substations)  
   - **Subsection B:** Socio-Economic Matrix  
     - Vulnerability index for 5 demographic groups (elderly, low-income, etc.)  
     - Map healthcare access vs. flood zones  

3. **Case Study: Port District Renewal**  
   - Redesign 15 km² industrial waterfront with:  
     - Phase-changing materials in flood walls  
     - Tidal wetland buffer zones (hectares required)  
     - Solar-microgrid integration (% energy independence)  
   - Relocation strategy for 200,000 residents (cost/benefit analysis)  

4. **Technical Solutions Blueprint**  
   - **System 1:** AI-optimized drainage network  
     - Sensor density per km²  
     - Machine learning model architecture (e.g., LSTM vs. GAN)  
   - **System 2:** Distributed renewable energy web  
     - Optimal mix: offshore wind (%) / osmotic power (%) / hydrogen storage (MWh)  

5. **Policy Framework**  
   - 5-year implementation timeline with milestones  
   - Financing mechanism (e.g., climate bonds, PPP ratios)  
   - Legal reforms needed (zoning laws, insurance mandates)  

6. **Cost-Benefit Simulation**  
   - 10-year ROI calculation comparing *status quo* vs. proposed plan  
   - Monte Carlo analysis of extreme weather scenarios (include NPV at 4% discount rate)  

7. **Ethical Safeguards**  
   - Algorithmic bias prevention in resource allocation AI  
   - Reparative justice measures for displaced communities  

**Formatting Constraints:**  
- 1,500 words minimum  
- 3 original diagrams (described textually)  
- 2 comparative tables  
- 5 academic citations (mix of climate science & urban economics)  

**Evaluation Rubric:**  
1. Cross-system synergy (energy ↔ transport ↔ ecology)  
2. Computational rigor of models proposed  
3. Scalability to other Köppen-Geiger climate zones  
4. Political feasibility score (1-10)  
5. Novelty index (% unprecedented solutions)  

**Final Output Must:**  
- Balance technical precision with public communication clarity  
- Contain at least 3 "anti-fragile" design elements (systems that improve under stress)  
- Reference successful precedents (e.g., Rotterdam's water plazas, Singapore's ABC Waters)  

This prompt tests: multi-modal reasoning, quantitative modeling, interdisciplinary synthesis, and ethical foresight—pushing LLMs to simulate complex system dynamics while maintaining human readability.
