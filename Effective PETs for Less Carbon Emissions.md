# Effective PETs (Prompt Engineering Techniques) to reduce carbon emissions

My analysis and exercices are based on the original document: [arxiv.or link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05899) and its authors: Riccardo Rubei, Aicha Moussaid, Claudio di Sipio, Davide di Ruscio

After deep reading the document I really liked to start experimenting their findings about using specialized PETs to reduce the amount of resources used when interacting with LLMs.
